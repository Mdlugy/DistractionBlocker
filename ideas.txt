try to do the following in windowCloser:

    import win32gui
    window = win32gui.GetForegroundWindow()
    print (window)

if the result can get us a path of some kind, we should send a CTRL+W when an offending folder's path is included in the active window

similarly, try to use a similar function to get the pid of active exe running and send ALT+F4

once either of these happen open a picture using irfanview that says "nice try, now get back to work."



create a GUI that will allow me to find folders from a dropdown, if the folder is set to "exe" check it against executables, if its not, check against open folders, a schedule as well as a timer and snooze feature.
